<h2>Invoking functions</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>As you remember, we have discussed <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10484" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A function in Kotlin is a block of code that you can execute and reuse throughout your program. | It is declared using the keyword 'fun', a name, a list of parameters (if needed), the return type, and the function body. Functions play a critical role in organizing code into manageable chunks, enabling code reuse, reducing redundancy, and enhancing readability. When you wrap specific operations inside a function, you build more modular and maintainable codebases.">functions</a> before. What is a function, though? How can we use them? A function is <strong>a sequence of instructions</strong>, we can invoke it<strong> </strong>from a program by calling its name. Functions represent subprograms, and they perform some actions, for example, printing data to the standard output, calculating a square root, and so on.</p><p>The picture below shows how functions work. Basically, it is just a box that processes input <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/25384" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An argument in Kotlin is a value that you pass to a function when you call it. | The argument is used by the function to perform its task. In Kotlin, you can use named arguments, which allows you to specify the name of the parameter when invoking the function. This feature is especially helpful when a function has numerous parameters with default values and you want to provide a non-default value for a parameter that is not the last one on the list.">arguments</a> (<strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11224" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="You are asking about the concept of input data in the context of the programming language Kotlin. | In this language, input data can be obtained through various means, such as user input from the console or reading data from a file. However, the specifics of how to handle input data in Kotlin are not provided in the context you have given. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to your question.">input data</a></strong>) and produces either a useful result or nothing.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><picture><img alt="how functions work" height="77" src="https://ucarecdn.com/8d498b2d-f6d1-4ead-965b-a2141ca20715/" width="300"/></picture></p><h5 id="functions-arguments">Functions arguments</h5><p>When we want to use a function, we can invoke (or call) it using its name followed by parentheses. If a function takes one or more arguments (input data), they should be passed in the parentheses.</p><p>In the example below, we invoke the <code class="language-kotlin">println</code> function with a single-string argument:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val text = "Hello"
println(text)</code></pre><p>This function can also take no arguments at all to print a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4637" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a new line is represented by the escape sequence `\n`. | This is used to indicate the start of a new line in a string or other text-based context.">new line</a>:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">println()</code></pre><p>So, in its general form, a function can be invoked like this:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">function1() // invokes function1 without an argument
function2(arg1) // invokes function2 while passing an argument
function3(arg1, arg2) // invokes function3 while passing two arguments
// ... and so on</code></pre><p>Where <code class="language-kotlin">function</code> is the name of a function.</p><h5 id="producing-a-result">Producing a result</h5><p>Some functions not only take arguments but also produce (<a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/39052" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, the 'return' keyword is used to exit a function and optionally return a value. | When a function returns, it implies that the function is invoked for its side effect, such as printing to the console, rather than for the result it returns. If a function does not return any valuable value, Kotlin provides the Unit type, which is comparable to void in languages like Java or C++. It's unnecessary to specify a return type in this case because it's the default return type if none is declared.">return</a>) some results. You can also assign it to a variable:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val result = function(arg)</code></pre><p>Functions that take arguments and produce a result look like regular math functions.</p><p>For example, let's take a look at a math function that returns the absolute value of a number:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val number = -10
val nonNegNumber = Math.abs(number) // it takes -10 and returns 10</code></pre><p>A benefit of using functions is that you don't need to implement anything, just invoke a function and it will work.</p><p>The name of the <code class="language-kotlin">abs</code> function is written after the dot symbol. The reason is that <code class="language-kotlin">Math</code> groups multiple functions, and we should write the name of the group to invoke one of them. We won't go into detail right now, just keep in mind that you will see something like that in our examples and practice problems.</p><p>All functions <strong>return</strong> a result, even the <code class="language-kotlin">println</code> function.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val result = println("text")
println(result) // kotlin.Unit</code></pre><p>The result is a special value called <code class="language-kotlin">Unit</code>, which practically means <code class="language-kotlin">no result</code>. When your function returns nothing, it means it returns <code class="language-kotlin">Unit</code>, that's all you need to understand for now. If you're coming from another language like C or Java, you can think of it as <code class="language-kotlin">Void</code>.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>In this topic, we have discussed what a function is and how to invoke standard functions in Kotlin. In the next topic, you'll find out how to declare your own functions and how to use functions written by other programmers.</p>
