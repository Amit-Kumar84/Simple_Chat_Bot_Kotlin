<h2>Standard input with Java Scanner</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Sometimes, it isn't enough to use <code class="language-kotlin">readln()</code> to read data from <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11224" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Yes, the standard input in Kotlin refers to the default source of input for a program, typically coming from the user's keyboard. | To read data from the standard input in Kotlin, you can use the `readLine()` function, which reads a whole line as a string. If you're using an older version of Kotlin, you can use `readLine()` instead. These functions read data from the standard input and return a string value.">standard input</a>. <code class="language-kotlin">readln()</code> is a simple method, not suitable for complex tasks, for example: find only <code class="language-kotlin">Integers</code> or only <code class="language-kotlin">Doubles</code> in a data flow, read data sequentially, word by word, and control such reading step by step. In this topic, you will learn to use one of Java tools that can be also used in Kotlin — <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code>.</p><h5 id="what-is-java-scanner">What is Java Scanner?</h5><p><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4643" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, the scanner is not a built-in feature like in some other programming languages. | However, Kotlin can utilize the Java Scanner class for reading input from various sources such as the console, files, or network connections. The Scanner class allows you to break down the input into tokens using delimiters, which can be useful for parsing and processing data. To use the Scanner class in Kotlin, you need to import the java.util package and create a Scanner object, specifying the input source.">Scanner</a> is another way to obtain data from standard input.

There are four visibility modifiers in Kotlin: public, private, protected, and internal. Public members are accessible from any code component, while private members are only accessible within the same file. Protected members are accessible within the same package and subclasses, and internal members are accessible within the same module.">access</a> it directly from Kotlin because it is interoperable with other Java <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/33986" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a library is a collection of pre-built functionality, such as functions, classes, and methods, that can be used in your code to extend the language's capabilities and simplify the coding process. | They can be categorized into standard library, which are included with the language and provide essential functionality, and third-party library, which offer specialized or advanced features.">libraries</a>. <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> allows a program to read values of <strong>different types </strong>(strings, numbers, etc.) from standard input.</p><p>To use it, you need to add the following import statement to the top of your file with the source code:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.util.Scanner</code></pre><p>or</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.util.*</code></pre><p>You can use either method to add <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> to your program.

The `readLine()` function in Kotlin is an example of an input stream, as it reads a line of text from the standard input and returns it as a string.
